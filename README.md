# Credit Card Default Prediction 🧠💳

This project was completed as part of my Data Science internship at **YBI Foundation** (Jun–Jul 2025). The goal was to build a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will default on their credit card payment.

## 📌 Project Overview
- Built a classification model to predict credit card default risk using **Python** in **Google Colab**
- Achieved **95% accuracy** using algorithms like **Logistic Regression** and **Decision Tree**
- Performed **data cleaning**, **EDA**, and **feature selection** using **pandas**, **NumPy**, and **scikit-learn**
- Evaluated the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and other key metrics
- Visualized data patterns with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Google Colab  
- pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  

## 📁 Files
- `Credit_Card_Default.ipynb`: Main notebook with all preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps
- `README.md`: Project summary and structure (this file)

## 📈 Results
The final model achieved **95% accuracy**, demonstrating strong performance in predicting defaults based on customer behavior and credit history.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
- Test more advanced models like Random Forest or XGBoost
- Deploy model using Flask or Streamlit for user interaction
